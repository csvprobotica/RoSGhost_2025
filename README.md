## Mobility
This robot is designed to evade lateral obstacles, complete three full rotations, and stop at its initial position using a rear motor for forward movement and a front motor for turning.

This mobility system allows the robot to autonomously navigate environments with obstacles, perform evasive maneuvers, and maintain precise orientation using the gyroscope.

Below are the key aspects of its mobility:
1. Continuous Forward Movement:
   - The rear motor, connected to port B, drives the robot forward at a constant speed.
   - The robot moves continuously while monitoring distances to obstacles on both sides.

2. Lateral Obstacle Evasion:
   - Three ultrasonic sensors are connected to ports D (right), E (left) and F (front).
   - These sensors detect obstacles on the sides of the robot.
   - If the right sensor detects a wall within 10 cm, the robot stops the rear motor and uses the front motor to turn 90 degrees to the left.
   - If the left sensor detects a wall within 10 cm, the robot stops the rear motor and uses the front motor to turn 90 degrees to the right.
   - After evading an obstacle, the rear motor resumes forward movement.

3. Turning and Navigation:
   - The front motor, connected to port A, is used exclusively for precise turns.
   - To turn 90 degrees to the left, the front motor is activated in the opposite direction for a specific duration.
   - To turn 90 degrees to the right, the front motor is activated in the direct direction for a specific duration.
   - Turns are calibrated to ensure the robot maintains its course and can navigate effectively around obstacles.

4. Gyroscope Utilization:
   - The integrated gyroscope in the LEGO Mindstorms hub is used to track the robot's orientation.
   - At the start, the gyroscope is reset to establish a zero-degree reference angle.
   - While the robot moves and evades obstacles, the gyroscope measures the cumulative turning angle.
   - The robot is programmed to complete three full rotations, totaling 1080 degrees.
   - Each time the gyroscope detects a 360-degree rotation, the lap counter is incremented and the gyroscope angle is reset.

5. Stopping at the Initial Position:
   - After completing the three rotations, the robot stops the rear motor and remains at the initial position, indicating the task is complete.

## Strategy
The code provided for the LEGO Mindstorms Inventor robot outlines a strategy for autonomous navigation, obstacle evasion, and precise rotational movements.

The strategy employed in this code enables the Lego Mindstorms Inventor robot to autonomously navigate its environment, avoid obstacles, and complete a series of precise rotations. By utilizing the rear motor for forward movement, the front motor for turning, and the gyroscope for orientation tracking, the robot can perform complex maneuvers and maintain accuracy in its movements. This approach ensures that the robot can handle dynamic environments and complete its assigned task effectively.

Here is a detailed description of the strategy implemented in the code:

1. Initialization:
   - The robot's hub, motors and ultrasonic sensors are initialized.
   - The rear motor (connected to port B) is designated for forward movement.
   - The front motor (connected to port A) is designated for turning.
   - Three ultrasonic sensors (connected to ports D,E and F) are used to detect obstacles on the right and left sides, respectively.

2. Continuous Forward Movement:
   - The robot starts moving forward at a constant speed using the rear motor.
   - This movement is continuous, allowing the robot to traverse its environment.

3. Obstacle Detection and Evasion:
   - While moving forward, the robot continuously monitors the distance to obstacles on both sides using the ultrasonic sensors.
   - If the right sensor detects an obstacle within 10 cm, the robot:
     - Stops the rear motor to halt forward movement.
     - Activates the front motor to turn 90 degrees to the left.
     - Waits for a short duration to complete the turn.
     - Resumes forward movement with the rear motor.
   - If the left sensor detects an obstacle within 10 cm, the robot:
     - Stops the rear motor.
     - Activates the front motor to turn 90 degrees to the right.
     - Waits for a short duration to complete the turn.
     - Resumes forward movement with the rear motor.
   - This ensures that the robot can navigate around obstacles and continue its path.

4. Gyroscope for Orientation and Rotation Tracking:
   - The robot uses the integrated gyroscope to maintain and track its orientation.
   - At the beginning of the operation, the gyroscope is reset to establish a zero-degree reference.
   - The gyroscope continuously measures the robot's turning angle to track its rotational progress.

5. Three Full Rotations:
   - The robot is programmed to complete three full rotations, equivalent to 1080 degrees.
   - Each time the gyroscope detects a 360-degree rotation, the rotation counter is incremented, and the gyroscope is reset.
   - The process of obstacle detection, evasion, and continuous forward movement ensures that the robot can complete its rotations without interruptions.

6. Completion and Stopping:
   - After completing the three full rotations, the robot stops the rear motor.
   - The robot remains in its final position, indicating the completion of its task.

## Challenges
_Well, one of our challenges was to ensure that it followed the correct trajectory in any position we placed the robot. Instead of viewing it as a problem, we took it as a fun challenge, always with discipline and a lot of care, but we saw it as a way to show that there is always room for improvement.._
